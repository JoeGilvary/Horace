## Horace



"Is this some kind of joke?" Already at 8:30 a.m., Adam Reynolds' remaining sandy hair was disheveled, his eyes and shoulders locked in an intense drooping competition. The cookout at his brother's place had been wild this past weekend. Adam barely made it home in time to wash up and get here by 8:00. It was probably his brother who thought it'd be funny to send this kid over here at this horrific hour.



"No sir," the job applicant replied smartly. His long-sleeved shirt was neat, its collar buttoned down, his hair neatly parted in a "boy next-door" sort of way. He was wearing what looked to Adam like a real bow tie, not one of those clip on things he used to wear himself for kicks back in high school. If it weren't for this bizarre job application on the desk, Adam would seek a way to bring him onto the team. He decided he'd give the kid five minutes to explain. He drained the cup of coffee, his fourth of the morning, then pointed to the "Recent Experience" blocks and asked, "Your job history is unusual, to say the least. What do you mean by 'spectral accompaniment?'"



"I'm a ghost, sir. I've had to give up my favorite haunt since the owner retired. It says right there on my application that I worked at Roger's Gas for the last seventy years. I'm both loyal and reliable, sir. I'm sure you know how low the margins are on gasoline these days. He said it just wasn't worth the aggravation. Now his shop is gone, the lot paved over as parking for the strip mall next door, as I'm sure you know. I can't haunt a parking lot. There's no future in it."



Like I need this aggravation, Adam thought. He raised the empty coffee mug, then shot a gaze to the pot across the room. Empty, and just a little past 8:30. It was going to be a long day. It would take more than that first pot of coffee to clear the tracks of the regiment that had marched across his tongue.



"Listen," Adam checked the application, "Horace, I get the impression that you would be reliable. You seem enthusiastic, full of spirit." He smiled, and Horace returned the smile, his face bright. "But what would a ghost do for my business? I'm a mechanic, my crew are mechanics."



"I can be very helpful around the shop, sir. I keep track of everything. I can observe anywhere. I am a very effective night guard. I need a place to call my home, and when I have found it, I give my all. I only require a single invitation to move in as my payment for all time."



Horace began to pick up steam as he spoke. He continued, "I can improve customer retention by raising satisfaction levels. Once, at Roger's a few years ago, one of the customers became quite irate when he thought that Roger, I mean Roger Senior, you know, well, this customer thought that Roger had lost the key to his car. The mechanic had left it under the floor mat of the car, just as they used to do when they'd finish up and the customer wasn't due back before closing…" The applicant went on with his story as Adam's thoughts turned to the day's work awaiting him and the crew. There was an SUV coming in to change the timing belt, two service appointments for the police fleet,…



Horace was still talking. "So when he finally checked in his pocket and found the key there, well, I'm sure you can imagine his embarassment." Horace chortled in a way that made Adam feel uncomfortable. Whoever had put Horace up to this chose the perfect kid for the job, just dorky enough to fit the role he played.



Adam's head throbbed with the fierce determination of a righteous, fire-and-brimstone kind of hangover. He reached in his desk for the asprin and decided at that moment that he would buy a coffee maker with a larger pot on his lunch break today. There was little chance he'd be spending any time eating, after all.



Horace smiled across the desk at him. "So you see, sir, I do have decades of experience working in the mechanical service trade, with a particular emphasis on resolution of customer satisfaction issues. But I have also been successful in the more modern sense as a 'team player.'"



Adam had to stop him. Now. This was not funny any longer, if it ever had been. "Very nice. Now I need to get back to work, so unless you can show me a ghostly task you'd be performing here, I'm afraid I'll…" Adam stopped as Horace vanished before his eyes. He watched as the previously empty coffee pot, now full of steaming black elixir, pulled itself from the hot plate and floated across the room to fill his mug. When the pot returned to its resting place, Horace appeared beside it.



"You're hired."
